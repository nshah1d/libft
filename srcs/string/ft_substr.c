/*
** The ft_substr function creates a substring from a given string.
**
** Parameters:
** s - A pointer to the source string.
** start - The starting index of the substring in the source string.
** len - The maximum length of the substring.
**
** Return:
** If memory allocation is successful or if len is zero, a pointer to the
** allocated substring is returned.
** If s is NULL or if memory allocation fails, NULL is returned.
**
** Description:
** The ft_substr function takes three parameters: s, start, and len. It first
** performs a check to ensure that s is not NULL. If s is NULL, it returns NULL
** to indicate an error. Next, it checks if the start index is greater than the
** length of the source string. If true, it means the start index is beyond the
** end of the source string, so it sets len to 0 to create an empty substring.
** Otherwise, it checks if the specified length exceeds the remaining
** characters in the source string after the start index. If true, it adjusts
** len to be equal to the number of characters remaining in the source string
** after the start index. The next step is to call the str_new function to
** allocate memory for the substring. The str_new function is defined as static
** in the code and is responsible for allocating memory. If memory allocation
** fails, str_new returns NULL, and ft_substr also returns NULL to indicate
** an error. If memory allocation is successful or if len is zero, ft_substr
** assigns the returned pointer to the str variable and increments the s
** pointer by the start index to position it at the start of the desired
** substring. It also assigns the str pointer to the str_ptr variable to keep
** track of the beginning of the substring. Then, it adds a null terminator at
** the end of the substring to ensure proper termination. Finally, ft_substr
** enters a loop that copies characters from the source string to the
** substring. It checks if len is not zero and if the current character in s is
** not a null terminator. Inside the loop, it assigns the value of the current
** character in s to the memory location pointed to by str and increments both
** pointers to move to the next character. It also decrements len to keep track
** of the remaining characters to be copied. This process continues until len
** becomes zero or until a null terminator is encountered. Once the loop ends,
** ft_substr returns the str_ptr pointer, which points to the beginning of the
** allocated substring. The function is useful when you need to extract a
** portion of a string to create a new substring.
**
** Example:
** char str[] = "Hello, World!";
** char *substring = ft_substr(str, 7, 5);
** (The function creates a substring "World" starting from index 7 of the
** source string)
**
** char *empty_substring = ft_substr(NULL, 0, 10);
** (The function returns NULL as the source string is NULL)
